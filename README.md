# Building the image

1.  Run `./docker/create_steam_secret_data.sh <username> <password> [<authcode>]`.
    This will try to log you in and on success it will pack all needed authentication
    information needed during the actual image build into a file named `userdata.tar`.
2.  Now run `docker build --build-arg STEAM_USERNAME=<username> .`. This will create the image.
